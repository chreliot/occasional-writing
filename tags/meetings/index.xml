      <description>I was delighted how much work in Philosophy of Ecology was presented at this year&amp;rsquo;s biennial meeting in Montr√©al of ISHPSSB, the International Society for History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology. It was the largest ISH so far, far larger than when I started attending 15 years ago, with about 550 presenters and 650 participants. The attendees also felt far more international than in years past, and represented 35 different countries.</description>

      <description>This week the blog of the Philosophy of Science Association&amp;rsquo;s Women&amp;rsquo;s Caucus posted a useful and interesting &amp;ldquo;experimental&amp;rdquo; syllabus created by Anya Plutynski. The model syllabus offers a nice overview of core topics in Philosophy of Science, using only female authors.
It&amp;rsquo;s a little more challenging to incorporate female authors into the early parts of a historically-organized philosophy of science couse, though philosophers like Susan Stebbing and May Brodbeck are worth a look.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, the American Naturalist Society&amp;rsquo;s Twitter account (@ASNAmNat) retweeted a question posed by Daniel Bolnick (@DanielBolnick):
Can anyone recommend a good reading to teach intro evolution grad students about philosophy of science as it pertains to doing research ?
&amp;mdash; Daniel Bolnick (@DanielBolnick) July 11, 2015 
This is even a bit tougher request than, for example, a single reading introducing evolutionary biology or genetics. Philosophy of science is less unified than those disciplines.</description>

      <description>I was delighted how much work in Philosophy of Ecology was presented at this year&amp;rsquo;s biennial meeting in Montr√©al of ISHPSSB, the International Society for History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Biology. It was the largest ISH so far, far larger than when I started attending 15 years ago, with about 550 presenters and 650 participants. The attendees also felt far more international than in years past, and represented 35 different countries.</description>
